# Foocus Installation

## What is Foocus?
Fooocus is an image generating software (based on Gradio).

Fooocus is a rethinking of Stable Diffusion and Midjourneyâ€™s designs:

Learned from Stable Diffusion, the software is offline, open source, and free.

Learned from Midjourney, the manual tweaking is not needed, and users only need to focus on the prompts and images.
